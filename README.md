# GatorPop
Lil Gator Game is a game about being an adorable gator who is getting all of their friends involved in their giant hero quest in order to convince their big sister to stop working on her college assignment and instead play with them.

This project is a tracker pack for [Poptracker](https://poptracker.github.io/) that works with Archipelago ([APWorld link](https://github.com/natronium/GatorArchipelago)) and a plugin for Lil Gator Game ([mod link](https://github.com/natronium/GatorRando)) to track the randomized items your character receives and what locations are available for them to check during either a solo or multiworld experience. If you are not familiar with Archipelago, we recommend reading Archipelago's introduction documents starting with the [FAQ](https://archipelago.gg/faq/en/).
